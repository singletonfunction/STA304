##### Practical Title: x-bar and R-charts

**Experiment:** The following are the mean and ranges of 20 samples of size 5 each. The data pertain to the overall length of fragmentation bomb base manufactured during the war by the American store camp.

$(a)$ From these data, obtain the control limits for $\bar X$ and  $R-Charts$ to control the length of bomb bases produced in the future.

$(b)$ The above samples were taken every 15 minutes in order of production. The production rate was 350 units per hour and tolerance were 0.820 and 0.840 inches.

On the assumption that the lengths of the bomb bases are normally distributed, what percentage of the bomb base would you estimate to have length outside the tolerance limits when the process is under control and the levels indicated by the above data?

â€‹		[For $n=5,$ use $A_2=0.58, \ D_3=0, \ D_4=2.12, \ d_2=2.326$]

**Aim:** To compute $(a)$ control limits for $\bar X$ and $R-charts$ to control the length of bomb bases produced in the future and $(b)$ estimate percent of bomb base outside the of tolerance limit when process is under control.

**Procedure:** $\displaystyle \bar{\bar X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \bar X_i$   and $\displaystyle \bar R=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nR_i$ 

Control limits on $\bar X -chart$ is given by:

$\displaystyle UCL_{\bar X}=\bar{\bar X}+A_2\bar R$ ,      $\displaystyle LCL_{\bar X}=\bar{\bar X}-A_2\bar R$  and  $CL_{\bar X}=\bar{\bar X}$  

Control limits on $R-chart$ is given by:

$\displaystyle UCL_R=D_4\bar R$ ,          $\displaystyle LCL_R=D_3\bar R$  and  $CL_R=\bar R$ 

In case when process is in control, estimate of population mean can be obtained as- $\displaystyle \hat{\mu}=\bar{\bar X}'$    and estimate of standard deviation can be obtained from R as-  $\displaystyle\hat\sigma=\frac{\bar R'}{d_2}$

- Control limit for $\bar X$ charts are  $\displaystyle UCL_{\bar X}=0.8379754, \\ CL_\bar X=0.8340778 \\ and \\ LCL_\bar X=0.8301802$

- Control limits for R-charts are $\displaystyle UCL_R=0.014098,\\ CL_R=0.00665 \\ and \\ LCL_R=0$ .

- Percent of bomb base outside the of tolerance limit when process is under control is $2.02$ .
